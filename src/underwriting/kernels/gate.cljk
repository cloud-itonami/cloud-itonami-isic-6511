(ns underwriting.kernels.gate
  "Safety kernel for the underwriting governor + phase gate — the
  decision CORE of `underwriting.governor/check` and
  `underwriting.phase/gate`, extracted into the safe-kotoba subset
  (cloud-itonami kernels discipline, ADR-0016 / superproject
  ADR-2607101200).

  Everything here is integer-coded and stays inside the emit-ready
  vocabulary: `defn`, `def` constants, nested `if`, `=`, `<`, integer
  arithmetic, recursion-free composition through named combinators. No
  keywords, strings, maps, atoms, host interop or I/O — the façades
  (`underwriting.governor`, `underwriting.phase`) reduce their inputs
  to flags/codes at the boundary and map the result codes back to
  keywords. `.kotoba`/wasm emission is deliberately NOT wired yet
  (owner decision 2026-07-12: ClojureScript + kotoba-datomic first);
  staying inside the subset is what keeps that door open without a
  rewrite.

  Wire codes:
    flag        0 = no, anything else = yes (norm-flag, fail-closed)
    confidence  int x100 (0..100); out-of-range counts as LOW (fail-closed)
    op          0 read (:coverage/report)   1 :application/intake
                2 :jurisdiction/assess      3 :kyc/screen
                4 :policy/bind              5+ unknown write (never enabled)
    phase       0..3 (anything else: no writes at all — the façade
                normalizes unknown phases to its own default BEFORE the
                kernel, so an out-of-range phase reaching the kernel is
                a bug and fails closed)
    verdict     0 ok/commit-eligible  1 escalate  2 hard-hold
    disposition 0 commit  1 escalate  2 hold
    reason      0 none  1 phase-disabled  2 phase-approval

  Fail-closed direction: every invalid/unknown input degrades toward
  LESS autonomy (hold/escalate), never more. `:policy/bind` (op 4) is
  auto-enabled at NO phase — the same structural invariant the phase
  table and the governor's actuation gate state independently."
